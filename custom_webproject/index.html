        Hi! My name is Máté Vass and I'm currently a junior developer at Codecool Miskolc.
        <br>My goal is to learn programming on different programming languages
        and sharpen those skills that I already achieved.
        <br>This site is part of a smaller project and one of the first that I ever built.
        I try to keep it simple and minimalistic so I can easily fiddle around with it,
        with out the need to keep attention to a lot of elements. I will try to improve it and add better styling
        and more functionality on the way. Also I will include the sourcecode of the site on the "About" tab.
        <br><br>With that being said, feel free to look around and thanks for visiting this site!

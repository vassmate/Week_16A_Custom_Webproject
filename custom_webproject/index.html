        Hi! My name is Máté Vass and I'm currently a junior developer at Codecool Miskolc.
        My current goal is to learn programming on different programming languages
        and sharpen those skills that I already achieved. I feel like I learned a lot in the last couple of months but
        I still have a lot to experience. This site is part of a smaller project and one of the first that I ever built.
        I tried to keep it simple and minimalistic so I can easily fiddle around with it,
        with out the need to keep attention to a lot of elements. I will try to improve it and add better styling
        and more functionality on the way. Also I will include the sourcecode for the site on the "About" tab.
        With that being said, feel free to look around and thanks for visiting this site!
    </p>
